There are 3 types of ship weaponry available:
 - [color=gold]Ballistics[/color], which are weapons like autocannons, railguns, and all other unguided chemical-propellant weapons.
 - [color=MediumVioletRed]Energy[/color], which are weapons like plasma weaponry, lasers, and other similar non-chemical based weapons. These have infinite ammo usually.
 - [color=GreenYellow]Missiles[/color], which are all guided munitions. It explains itself.

Ship weapons all need a [color=orange]gunnery control console[/color] and a [color=slateblue]gunnery control server[/color] to function. They will be abbreviated to [color=orange]GCC[/color] and [color=slateblue]GCS[/color] in most instances.
 - [color=gold]Ballistics[/color] and [color=GreenYellow]Missiles[/color] also require ammunition.
 - Ammunition can be [color=red]very volatile[/color] if damaged.

Ship weapons only fire if they are selected and if your cursor on the [color=orange]GCC[/color] is in the FOV of the turret.

Missiles will only track grids with a shuttle console, and are immediately pointed towards their tracked target upon detecting a target. Take into account the detection angle of your missiles, you can fire a lot farther than what the FOV of your turrets will allow if you do.

Most missiles have a tracking delay before attempting to seek out targets, and will not lock onto targets around 200 meters or less away from the origin ship, depending on the missile size.
